In this assignment, we use logistic regression and random forest algorithms to implement classification of the given datasets using scikit learn, and test each on 2 classification datasets, i.e., Iris, Wine, and Breast Cancer.

### ways to run code:
1. Download the .ipynb file and open it on jupyter lab, make sure scikit learn and matplot modules are inserted.
2. ? <br>
