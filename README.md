In this assignment, we use logistic regression and random forest algorithms to implement classification of the given datasets using scikit learn, and test each on 2 classification datasets, i.e., Iris, Wine, and Breast Cancer.

### Ways to run code:
1. Download the .ipynb file and open it on jupyter lab, make sure scikit learn and matplot modules are inserted. (recommended)
2. Download the .py file and open it on pycharm, then run the program.

In the report, there will be analysis and illustrations of model behind the scene
